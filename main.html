	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of how long it takes to run an algorithm as a function of the length of its input.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> is the amount of memory an algorithm needs to solve a problem, including the memory used by the input data and any additional memory required for the algorithm to run.Therefore, the space complexity of the function grows linearly with the input. We can describe this function as O(n) in Big O notation.</p>
